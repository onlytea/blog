I agree with Hotz's philosophy of having control with us rather than giving it away to a handful of companies. Just like linux. It's a big big task and geniuses like himself are really trying hard. For someone like me who watches the space from afar, I don't feel like I can contribute anything there primarily because it's a skill issue.
