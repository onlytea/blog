#### 2026-01-22: Github blog setup
##### What caught my attention
- (Quick note on why this idea seemed interesting)
- Github pages are awesome. Free hosting. Jekyll theme rocks for simplicity, and no fuss.

##### What I tried
- (Any experiments, code snippets, links, dead ends, etc.)
- Setup my github pages blog. It's live now.
- Got it up and running on local machine as well so that I can preview while setting things up. 

##### Current state
- (What works, what didn’t, or why I stopped)
- The page is live, so I guess I'm done for today. 

##### If I come back to this
- (Next steps, things to check, or questions for future me)
- I'll add more to this log. The goal is to commit daily to this log
