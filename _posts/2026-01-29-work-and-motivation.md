I'm slacking at work. There is no motivation to work. The monthly salary is really very addictive. I'm sitting here like half my brain that is supposed to be engaged with the world is paralyzed. The half that's active asks for stimulation - doesn't matter what kind but it can't be work related. I don't know if it's the atmosphere or the fact that the company is being bought and sold like an artifact. I really want to get out.
